# Quarter 3 Python Assignments

## What is this?
This is a collection of my Python assignments for Quarter 3. I’m a beginner learning Python, and these projects help me practice coding. In these projects, I’ll work with cool tools like Streamlit, Chainlit, and UV Agentic AI to make them more fun and useful!

## Assignments Included
**Assignments:
   **Basic Python Stuff**  
   - Things like lists, dictionaries, and loops to get started with coding.


   **Chatbot Project**  
   - A simple chatbot that talks back to you (like an echo).


   **Data Organizer**  
   - Something to store and manage data, like a mini phonebook or shopping list.

## Tools I’ll Add
- **Streamlit**: To make web apps with Python—like showing my projects online with buttons and visuals.
- **Chainlit**: To build chatbots that I can talk to in a chat window.
- **UV Agentic AI**: To add smart features (like an AI helper) to my projects.

## How to Run It
1. **Get Python**: Make sure Python is on your computer (I use version 3.9 or higher).
2. **Install Tools**: Open your terminal and type:
